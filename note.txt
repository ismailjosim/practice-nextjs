What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code execution in JavaScript?

1. Synchronous code execution means that the code is executed without waiting for the previous line to complete, while asynchronous code execution means that the code is executed in sequential order.

2. Synchronous code execution means that the code is executed in a sequential order, while asynchronous code execution means that the code is executed without waiting for the previous line to complete.

3. Synchronous code execution means that the code is executed without any delays, while asynchronous code execution means that the code is delayed before execution.

4. Synchronous code execution means that the code is executed in parallel, while asynchronous code execution means that the code is executed in a single thread.
